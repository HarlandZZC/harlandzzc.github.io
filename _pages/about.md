Hello! My name is Haolin He. I am currently a first-year PhD student in the [DSP Lab](http://dsp.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/) of the Department of Electrical Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/).

Before this, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Communication Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in Chengdu. I graduated with an honors degree and was recognized as an Outstanding Graduate at both the university and provincial levels.

I am now supervised by [Qiuqiang Kong](https://qiuqiangkong.github.io/). My undergraduate thesis advisor is [Fan Zhang](https://zhangfanmark.github.io/). I am grateful for their support.

My research interests are in artificial intelligence and its applications to various signal processing problems, such as audio processing and neuroimaging analysis.

I am a volunteer at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

Please feel free to contact me via email, or visit the DSP Lab for in-person discussions!
