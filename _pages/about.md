Hello! My name is Haolin He. I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [DSP Lab](http://dsp.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/) of the Department of Electronic Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/).

Before this, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Communication Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in Chengdu. I graduated with an honors degree and was recognized as an Outstanding Graduate at both the university and provincial levels.

I am now supervised by [Qiuqiang Kong](https://qiuqiangkong.github.io/). My undergraduate thesis advisor is [Fan Zhang](https://zhangfanmark.github.io/).

My research interests are in artificial intelligence and its applications to various signal processing problems, such as audio processing and neuroimaging analysis.

Please feel free to contact me via email, or visit the DSP Lab for in-person discussions!
