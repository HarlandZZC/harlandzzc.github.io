1. Avoid seeking quick success (discover things yourself—it's great!).
2. Be like a sponge, learn from books, materials, and others.
3. Stay humble, modest, and listen more. Everyone has strengths. Learn from both the older and younger generations.
4. Be pragmatic. Do more, talk less. Practice and apply your knowledge.
5. Be truthful and grounded. Stay hands-on and ensure you're constantly learning. During the learning phase, focus more on input than output.
6. Build a solid foundation in mathematics and physics and maintain a broad academic vision.
7. Develop strong programming skills; run tutorial codes frequently.
8. Dedicate 4 hours daily to studying math, physics, and research papers, and another 4 hours to coding. Execution is key.
9. Once you reach a certain level, you'll engage in more meaningful academic exchanges. Strengthen your core competencies.
10. The quality of research is more important than the quantity. Each paper should be of high quality with clean, open-source code that benefits others.
11. Nurturing scientific literacy and potential is more crucial than publishing many papers.
12. Approach your work with the humility of a first-year graduate student. Go through the same learning path as a master's student.
13. Everyone's PhD journey is unique; focus on uncovering your own distinctiveness.
14. Contribute valuable work to the academic community.
15. The ranking of your school or lab’s achievements is not directly related to your personal success. Focus on your own results.
16. Be altruistic.
17. Strive to be a thoughtful and deep-thinking PhD student.
