- Avoid seeking quick success.
- Be like a sponge, learn from books, materials, and others.
- Stay humble, modest, and listen more. Everyone has strengths. Learn from both the older and younger generations.
- Be pragmatic. Do more, talk less. Practice and apply your knowledge.
- Be truthful and grounded. Stay hands-on and ensure you're constantly learning. During the learning phase, focus more on input than output.
- Build a solid foundation in mathematics and physics and maintain a broad academic vision.
- Develop strong programming skills; run tutorial codes frequently.
- Dedicate 4 hours daily to studying math, physics, and research papers, and another 4 hours to coding. Execution is key.
- Once you reach a certain level, you'll engage in more meaningful academic exchanges. Strengthen your core competencies.
- The quality of research is more important than the quantity. Each paper should be of high quality with clean, open-source code that benefits others.
- Nurturing scientific literacy and potential is more crucial than publishing many papers.
- Approach your work with the humility of a first-year graduate student. Go through the same learning path as a master's student.
- Everyone's PhD journey is unique; focus on uncovering your own distinctiveness.
- Contribute valuable work to the academic community.
- The ranking of your school or labâ€™s achievements is not directly related to your personal success. Focus on your own results.
- Be altruistic.
- Strive to be a thoughtful and deep-thinking PhD student.
